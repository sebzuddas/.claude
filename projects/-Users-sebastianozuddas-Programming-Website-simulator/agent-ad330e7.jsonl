I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans.

I'll explore your codebase, understand the architecture, and provide a detailed implementation plan with the critical files needed to execute it.\n\nWhat would you like me to help plan?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":908,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":230,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWTFG3vA7xoouYbusAsaZ","type":"assistant","uuid":"5632288f-4716-4e61-ba8b-fbba6edb4b55","timestamp":"2025-12-25T10:27:49.946Z"}
